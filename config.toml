Gitter is a startup building a messaging product for developers. Acquired by GitLab in 2017. At last check, platform has over 1.2M RU, 800K monthly uniques.

I lead a small team of engineers (started as 2, grew to 6) at Gitter to build an extensive product comprised of:

* Web, mobile web, embedded plugin (sidecar)
* Public API
* IRC bridge
* Web-hooks API
* Public streaming and web-socket endpoints
* Mobile applications for iOS and Android
* Desktop applications for OSX, Linux, Windows
* Various open source clients for Gitter, other projects

As the CTO, responsible for:

* Leading the technology roadmap of the company
* Leading and implementing the architecture of our application software, cloud infrastructure and client applications.
* Leading the engineering and devops teams
* Capacity planning
* Dealing with anything that is holding back team productivity (intra-personal conflicts, process problems, technical debt)

Gitter is a modern cloud-based app built on universal/isomorphic Javascript using open source technologies, including:

* Backend: node.js for web, api, websockets, linux & windows desktop apps
* Frontend:  Marionette, lodash, Backbone, ReactJS, webpack, babel for bundling
* Mobile: Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C, Swift) Hybrid/Isomorphic Javascript
* Peristence: MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch, Neo4j

The small team size means we automate as much as possible, including provisioning, deployment and reliability operations using Ansible, Jenkins, monit, Datadog, PagerDuty, Nomad, Consul and others. In four years, we’ve had only a handful of self-inflicted outages and we each time we’ve made changes to mitigate the problem occurring again.

Maintained a hands-on approach to leading the team: writing and reviewing code, profiling and correcting production performance issues, working alongside our devops engineer to build out the EC2-based infrastructure, dealing with PagerDuty alerts and anything else that you may encounter as an engineer working in a small startup.
